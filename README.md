## This is 99% for me, but here are some quotes from students that I hold on to, to remind me what's important:
<p style="text-align: center;"><i>You were one of my favorite instructors. Your story about your undergrad really resonated with me as a low income student, which is not something that happens often at NYU. Because you learned a lot of these things on your own I felt like you really understood where confusion could be and helped simplify things in ways some other TAs couldn't.</i></p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Very super duper helpful with python. would take you step by step and explain each line of code in detail. would really make sure you UNDERSTOOD the content instead of just doing it. makes me feel like maybe i am ‚Äúcut out ‚Äúfor psych. thanks rob üôè</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Rob was a very good instructor. I feel that he is well cut out for teaching. He encouraged me during calc day when I was struggling and I really appreciated it. Rob also make analogies that help a lot to relate difficult topic in math to real life</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Thank you for being so open and down to earth with us during our 2 weeks. Not only was your Growing up in Science talk so inspirational and moving, but you showed me that there is not such thing as a missed opportunity.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Amazing, just amazing. Very patient and just knew how to connect super well with the class</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Rob's passion for his work exudes in his teaching. His advice through growing up in science was very helpful. Did a good job of explaining topics.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Rob was super nice and a wonderful TA. You can tell he really cares about teaching and helping us succeed. His GUIS was touching and he went above and beyond when providing resources for us.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>You're awesome :}</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I really enjoyed when you teached because I could ask any question and I wouldn't be judged for asking a stupid question LOL. I also liked your manner of explaining concepts, going back to the basics so students build a solid foundation of understanding of complex topic, making it very engaging and interesting.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>I really enjoyed Rob's teaching style and his ability to break down complex topics into comprehensible terms. His Growing Up in Science was incredibly inspiring and his ability to overcome adversity really helped me reflect and feel motivated to continue pursuing higher education.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Rob is an amazing teacher he is clear, concise and interactive. He makes great eye contact with students and really has this great enthusiasm that is refreshing and admirable. I enjoyed his sessions as it shows that he want students to thrive. He doesn't shy away from participation even from shy students. Whenever asked for helped, he was very attentive.</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Rob thank you for all your knowledge and for being so real with us. I really grasped most the concepts you taught and it felt really good to know you were there for support regardless of how well the information was absorbing upon first view. You were super super helpful and I'm really grateful</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Was great at explaining and walking through problem sets when questions were asked. Linear algebra lesson was great.</i></p>

**And some others that were more... mixed (but still good to look back on!):**

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>Please, please, please consider motivating why you are about to teach something. Start with an example instead of going through 2 hours of derivations and playing with numbers beforewe realize why we should care. Because no amount of coff ee is going to convince me that I should care about all these formulas unless you tell me how they're used fi rst. Please. Justmotivate it at the beginning. ESPECIALLY before you start teaching about dot products. Also: Rob is the absolute best TA and deserves a raise- he is an incredible teacher, and was an immense help in this course and I am so grateful for him and all the time he put in for all of us. You rock, Rob!!!</i></p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><i>This class needs to be completely overhauled. It doesn't make sense that most of the time is spent on crazy derivations for functions that already exist, rather than actually focusing onreal world applications of the math and functions. The TAs (especially Rob) were great, but the HW was entirely too time consuming with nitpicky grading</i></p>
