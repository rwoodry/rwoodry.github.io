#### Academic Blurb
I'm a doctoral candidate in [Jon Winawer's](https://wp.nyu.edu/winawerlab/) lab at New York University, and am co-advised on several projects by [Clay Curtis](https://www.clayspacelab.com/), [Grace Lindsay](https://lindsay-lab.github.io/), and [Serra Favila](https://sites.brown.edu/favila-lab/).

Previously, I was a lab manager working for [Liz Chrastil](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/spatialneuro/) at University of California, Irvine. As an undergrad I was advised by [Kate Yurgil](https://www.loyno.edu/academics/faculty-and-staff-directory/kate-yurgil) at Loyola University New Orleans, where I received a B.S. in Psychological Sciences.
