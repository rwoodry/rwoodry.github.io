I use neuroimaging experiments and computational models to understand how the brain's visual system is used during memory and imagery.

I'm a doctoral candidate in [Jon Winawer's](https://wp.nyu.edu/winawerlab/) lab at New York University, and am wrapping up a PhD in [Cognition & Perception](https://as.nyu.edu/departments/psychology/graduate/phd-cognition-perception.html) with a concentration in quantitative methods.
