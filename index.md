Welcome to my website! A bit about me: 

I'm Cuban-American, born and raised in Miami. I love playing music, reading books, and trying to make math make sense in my head. 

I'm also a neuroscientist.

My research focuses on understanding how our brain's visual system is used to generate images when we remember and imagine things. I'm particularly interested in the neural signals in the brain that shape these generated images, and how and where these processes can go wrong.

#### Academic Blurb
I'm a doctoral candidate in [Jon Winawer's](https://wp.nyu.edu/winawerlab/) lab at New York University, and am co-advised on several projects by [Clay Curtis](https://www.clayspacelab.com/), [Grace Lindsay](https://lindsay-lab.github.io/), and [Serra Favila](https://sites.brown.edu/favila-lab/).

Previously, I was a lab manager working for [Liz Chrastil](https://faculty.sites.uci.edu/spatialneuro/) at University of California, Irvine. As an undergrad I was advised by [Kate Yurgil](https://www.loyno.edu/academics/faculty-and-staff-directory/kate-yurgil) at Loyola University New Orleans, where I received my B.S. in Psychological Sciences.
