<p style="text-align: center;">Welcome to my website! A bit about me:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">I'm Cuban-American, born and raised in Miami.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">I love playing music, reading books, and trying to make math make sense in my head.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">And, I'm a neuroscientist.</p>

My research focuses on understanding how the brain's visual system is used to generate images when we remember and imagine things. I'm particularly interested in the neural signals in the brain that shape these generated images, and how and where these processes can go wrong.
