*I wrote a couple python notebooks introducing some basic concepts in Linear Algebra, as part of my involvement teaching in this year's (2025) NYU Undergraduate Math and Coding Bootcamp. You can find a github repo with this year's notebooks [here](https://github.com/rwoodry/UMCB_2025).*

This notebook introduces different kinds of matrices and how they can be used. The goal here is to build up intuition for a powerful method in Linear Algebra: The Singular Value Decomposition. This method lets you think of a matrix as a linear system that transforms input data to output via three stages: Rotation, Scaling, Rotation.
