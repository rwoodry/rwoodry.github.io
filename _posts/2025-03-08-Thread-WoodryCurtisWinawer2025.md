New paper! @rewaniw.bsky.social, Clay Curtis, and I use fMRI to show that the way visual representations are routed through cortex when seeing vs. remembering affects their precision. We link this to behavior & show how task demand plays a role. Follow the ðŸ§µ for more!

When retrieving visual memories or creating images in our heads, our visual cortex lights up too, even though we're not actually seeing anything. Previous research has focused on how similar these brain patterns are to when seeing, in line with ideas of 'cortical reinstatement'

But perception and memory should also differ! One comes from the eyes (bottom-up) while the other is generated in our head (top-down). Yet both produce representations in visual cortex.  

We figured that these representations likely differ in early visual cortex due to how they get there.

To test this we scanned humans while they either viewed, held in working memory, or retrieved from long-term memory a peripheral target. After a delay, they made a saccade to the target's location

We measured the precision of visual representations across the visual hierarchy during the delay

To do this we first used fMRI to map small mm-size regions in visual cortex to regions in visual space that they most respond to.

This let us both (1) map visual areas V1-IPS0, and (2) measure how much an area's activation pattern spreads across the visual field, aka it's spatial precision

We found that, compared to perception, visual representations were much less precise in early visual cortex during both long-term memory (a replication of prior work in the lab) AND working memory!

This disparity b/w perception and memory was largest in V1, converging later in the hierarchy

We also quantified the precision of perceptual and memory responses over the (12s) delay. We show that the working memory response intuitively begins similar to perception, but then gradually becomes less precise over the delay in early visual cortex, becoming more like long-term memory!

We also found that the location of peak activity in visual cortex during long-term memory predicted the direction of the memory-guided saccade response error, such that memory responses peaking clockwise of the target preceded saccade errors in the same direction.

While the less precise long-term memory vs. perceptual response in early visual cortex broadly replicated prior work in the lab by Serra Favila, we found that they were nearly twice as precise as previously reported.

Why is that?

Our studies mainly differed in the number of memorized targets. 16 here, 4 there 

What if the increased competition as a result of memorizing 4x more targets led to more precisely retrieved visual representations?

Luckily, I figured out a way to test this w/o spending ðŸ’° on more scans...

Our targets varied in spacing around the visual field. Some were close together, others far apart.

And while never shown together, subjects were penalized during training for making saccades closer to their nearby competitors; some targets required more precision during training than others

11/15
- - -
So, I split long-term memory trials by whether the target was spaced near to or far from its nearest competitor

And I found that representations in early visual cortex for 'near' trials were nearly 2x as precise as 'far' trials!

This was a cool find, one we didn't design the study for.

This suggests that increased precision demands at training lead to increased precision in the visual representations retrieved during later recall â€” and that we can quantify these effects as early as V1 (!!!)

More experiments are needed to tease apart demands at encoding vs. retrieval

Overall, this study quantifies how the precision of visual representations during perception and memory varies (1) as a function of how information is routed through visual cortex, (2) over brief periods of time, (3) how it maps to memory behavior, and (4) as a function of task demands.

Lastly, this was my first EVER paper. Took 3 years to see it through. I'm so so so grateful to all the advisors and lab mates who invested in & helped get me to this point (Shoutout to @chrastil.bsky.social for hiring me as a lab manager, and Kate Yurgil @ LoyNO)

It's the first of many!
